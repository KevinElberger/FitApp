## FitApp

FitApp is a web application that allows users to track their weightlifting and weight progress over time. FitApp utilizes the D3.JS graphing library to display visually appealing graphs of a user's lift numbers plotted throughout time, as well as to display how a user's weight has adjusted over time.
